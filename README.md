This project is a simple password manager built in Python using the `cryptography` library's `Fernet` encryption, focusing on cybersecurity best practices. 
It starts by generating a secure encryption key, which is stored in a file for later use, emphasizing the importance of key security. 
The manager allows users to encrypt and decrypt passwords, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. 
Users can add passwords associated with labels, which are securely stored in a JSON file. 
The interface is command-line based, offering options to add or retrieve passwords easily, with basic error handling for non-existent labels. 
By encrypting passwords, the project enhances data confidentiality and integrity. 
It emphasizes the need for securely managing the encryption key and regularly backing up password data to prevent loss. 
Potential improvements include implementing user authentication and password strength validation. 
Overall, it's a foundational tool for securely managing passwords while adhering to cybersecurity principles.
